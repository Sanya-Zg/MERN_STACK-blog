# MERN Blog with Admin Panel

In this project, I demonstrated my skills in building a **full-stack MERN application**.  
This is a blog platform with an **admin panel**.

- **Registered users** have partial access (view posts, leave comments).
- **Admin users** have full access:
  - Create, edit, and delete posts
  - Manage users
  - View total number of users and comments
